Qualcomm Technologies Inc. IPA Offload Sub-System Device

IPA Offload Sub-system is a generic kernel framework that enables a
third-party ethernet driver to attach an ethernet peripheral to IPA
for hardware offloading of tethered data paths.

For each device attached to IOSS, we can define IPA offload data path
configuration through below devicetree properties.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "qcom,ioss-v2-device"
- qcom,ioss : specify which IOSS platform device to be used
- qcom,ioss_interfaces : to specify interface names and its channel config

Example:

&pcie_rc1 {
	aqc_x2: qcom,aqc@1 {
		compatible = "qcom,ioss-v2-device";

		qcom,ioss = <&ioss>;
		qcom,ioss_interfaces =
			<&ioss_aqc_eth0>;
};
