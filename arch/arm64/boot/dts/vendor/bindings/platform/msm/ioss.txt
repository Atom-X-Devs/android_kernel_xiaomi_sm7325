Qualcomm Technologies Inc. IPA Offload Sub-System

IPA Offload Sub-system is a generic kernel framework that enables a
third-party ethernet driver to attach an ethernet peripheral to IPA
for hardware offloading of tethered data paths. The framework
provides a generic API interface that ethernet drivers can use to
register their hardware functionality with the sub-system in order
to enable IPA offload.
