Qualcomm SDM845 Network-On-Chip interconnect driver binding
-----------------------------------------------------------

SDM845 interconnect providers support system bandwidth requirements through
RPMh hardware accelerators known as Bus Clock Manager (BCM). The provider is
able to communicate with the BCM through the Resource State Coordinator (RSC)
associated with each execution environment. Provider nodes must point to at
least one RPMh device child node pertaining to their RSC and each provider
can map to multiple RPMh resources.

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,sdm845-aggre1-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-aggre2-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-config-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-dc-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-gladiator-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-mem-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-mmss-noc",
			"qcom,sdm845-system-noc",
- #interconnect-cells : should contain 1
- reg : shall contain base register location and length
- qcom,bcm-voters : shall contain phandles to bcm voters

Optional properties:
qcom,bcm-voter-names : List of bcm-voter name strings sorted in the same
		  order as the qcom,bcm-voters property. The names will
		  be used to differentiate the specific RSC being targeted.

Examples:

mem_noc: interconnect@1380000 {
	compatible = "qcom,sdm845-mem-noc";
	reg = <0 0x01380000 0 0x27200>;
	#interconnect-cells = <1>;
	qcom,bcm-voter-names = "apps_rsc", "disp_rsc";
	qcom,bcm-voters = <&apps_bcm_voter>, <&disp_bcm_voter>;
};
aggre1_noc: interconnect@16e0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,sdm845-aggre1-noc";
	reg = <0x016e0000 0xd080>;
	interconnect-cells = <1>;
	qcom,bcm-voters = <&apps_bcm_voter>;
};

mmss_noc: interconnect@1740000 {
	compatible = "qcom,sdm845-mmss-noc";
	reg = <0x01740000 0x1c1000>;
	interconnect-cells = <1>;
	qcom,bcm-voter-names = "apps_rsc", "disp_rsc";
	qcom,bcm-voters = <&apps_bcm_voter>, <&disp_bcm_voter>;
};
