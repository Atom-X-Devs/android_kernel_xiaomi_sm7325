* Low Power Management Levels

The application processor in MSM can do a variety of C-States for low power
management. The LPM module performs the System low power modes based on
the latency/residency information of the individual CPUs and clusters.

LPM-levels defines a hierarchy of low power modes that a cluster and
clusters/cpus within that cluster can enter. The bottom hierarchy level
represents the low power modes that a CPU can enter. The CPU low power nodes
are associated with a cluster that defines the low power modes that a cluster
can enter. For system involving a hierarchy of clusters, the cluster low power
modes can be contained within another cluster.

[Top Level Node]
Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,lpm-levels"

[Node bindings for qcom,pm-cluster]
 Required properties:
	- label: Identifies the cluster name. The name is used when reporting
	the stats for each low power mode.
	- qcom,psci-mode-shift: The property is used to determine with bit
	location of the cluster mode in the composite state ID used to define
	cluster low power modes in PSCI.
	- qcom,psci-mode-mask: The property is used to determine with bit
	mask of the cluster mode in the composite state ID used to define
	cluster low power modes in PSCI.

Optional properties:
	- reg: The address range
	- reg-names: Specifies the address field names.
	- qcom,disable-prediction: This property is used to indicate the LPM
	governor will not use LPM prediction for this cluster.
	- qcom,clstr-tmr-add: This property is used as correction timer for
	wrong prediction by lpm prediction algorithm for cluster predictions.
	This value should be between 100 to 1500. Higher values would mean
	longer time staying in shallower state before waking up to select a
	deeper state in case of wrong prediction.
	qcom,pm-cluster contains qcom,pm-cluster-level nodes which identify
	the various low power modes that the cluster can enter. The
	qcom,pm-cluster node should also include another cluster node or a cpu
	node that defines their respective low power modes.

[Node bindings for qcom,pm-cluster-level]
 Required properties:
	- compatible: must be "arm,idle-state"
	- reg: The numeric cpu level id
	- idle-state-name: Name to identify the low power mode in stats
	- qcom,psci-cpu-mode: ID to be passed into PSCI firmware.
	- arm,psci-suspend-param: State ID for the CPU idle state
	- entry-latency-us: The latency to enter LPM level, in uSec
	- exit-latency-us: The latency to exit LPM level, in uSec
	- min-residency-us: The minimum residency value from which entering
	to low power mode is beneficial, in uSec
	- qcom,min-child-idx: The minimum level that a child CPU should be in
	before this level can be chosen. This property is required for all
        non-default level.

 Optional properties:
	- qcom,notify-rpm: When set, the driver configures the sleep and wake
	sets. It also configures the next wakeup time for APPS.
	- qcom,is-reset: This boolean property tells whether cluster level need
	power management notifications to be sent out or not for the drivers to
	prepare for cluster collapse.
	- qcom,reset-level: This property is used to determine in this
	low power mode only control logic power collapse happens or memory
	logic power collapse aswell happens or retention state.
	The accepted values for this property are:
		"LPM_RESET_LVL_NONE" - No power collapse
		"LPM_RESET_LVL_RET"  - Retention state
		"LPM_RESET_LVL_GDHS" - Only control logic power collapse (GDHS)
		"LPM_RESET_LVL_PC" - Control logic and memory logic
					power collapse (PC)

[Node bindings for qcom,pm-cpu]
qcom,pm-cpu contains the low power modes that a cpu could enter and the CPUs
that share the parameters.It contains the following properties.
	- qcom,cpu: List of CPU phandles to identify the CPUs associated with
	this cluster.
	- qcom,psci-mode-shift: Same as cluster level fields.
	- qcom,psci-mode-mask: Same as cluster level fields.
	- qcom,pm-cpu-levels: The different low power modes that a CPU could
	enter. The following section explains the required properties of this
	node.

Optional properties:
	- qcom,disable-prediction: This property is used to indicate the
	LPM governor is to disable sleep prediction to this cpu.
	- label: Identifies the cluster name. The name is used when parsing the
	RIMPS addresses.
	- qcom,ref-stddev: This property is used as reference standard deviation
	in lpm prediction algorithm. This value should be between 100 to 1000.
	Higher value would result in more predictions and thereby resulting in
	shallower low power modes.
	- qcom,tmr-add: This property is used as correction timer for wrong
	prediction by lpm prediction algorithm. This value should be between
	100 to 1500. Higher values would mean longer time staying in shallower
	state before waking up to select a deeper state in case of wrong prediction.
	- qcom,ref-premature-cnt: This property is used as reference premature
	count to predict next sleep state by the prediction algorithm. This value
	should be between 1 to 5. Higher value for this parameter would result in
	less predictions to disallow deeper low power modes.

[Node bindings for qcom,pm-cpu-levels]
 Required properties:
	- compatible: must be "arm,idle-state"
	- reg: The numeric cpu level id
	- idle-state-name: Name to identify the low power mode in stats
	- qcom,psci-cpu-mode: ID to be passed into PSCI firmware.
	- arm,psci-suspend-param: State ID for the CPU idle state
	- entry-latency-us: The latency to enter LPM level, in uSec
	- exit-latency-us: The latency to exit LPM level, in uSec
	- min-residency-us: The minimum residency value from which entering
	to low power mode is beneficial, in uSec

 Optional properties:
	- qcom,is-reset: This boolean property maps to "power state" bit in PSCI
	state_id configuration. This property will tell whether CPU get reset for
	a particular LPM or not. This property is also used to notify the drivers
	in case of cpu reset.
	- qcom,use-broadcast-timer: Indicates that the timer gets reset during
	power collapse and the cpu relies on Broadcast timer for scheduled wakeups.
	Required only for states where the CPUs internal timer state is lost.
