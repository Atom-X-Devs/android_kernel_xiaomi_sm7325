CPU Voltage cooling device:
===============================================================================
A single cluster can have CPUs with different frequency plans.
Mitigating individual CPU may or may not bring down the CPU cluster
voltage depending on the operating level of the other CPUs.

CPU voltage cooling device will provide support to apply CPU frequency
mitigation on the different CPUs in a cluster to achieve a reduction in
cluster voltage. This is achieved by building a mitigation table mapping
the CPU frequency levels to a voltage.

Required Parameters:
- compatible: must be 'qcom,cc-cooling-devices' for cpu voltage cooling device
  driver.

	voltage cooling device node properties:
	- apc1_cluster: thermal-cluster-a-b
		Usage: required
		Definition : CPU voltage cooling device node name. where 'a' is the
		1st core of 1st cluster and 'b' is 1st core of 2nd cluster.

	-qcom,cluster0:
		Usage: required
		Value type: An array of CPU phandle
		Definition: Specify array of CPU phandles available in 1st cluster,
			which needs to be used for building a voltage based mitigation
			table.

	-qcom,cluster1:
		Usage: required
		Value type: An array of CPU phandle
		Definition: Specify array of CPU phandles available in 2nd cluster,
			which needs to be used for building a voltage based mitigation
			table.

	-#cooling-cells:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <integer>
		Definition: Must be 2. Needed for of_thermal as cooling device
			identifier. Please refer to
			<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
			details.


Optional Parameters:

Example:
	qcom,cpu-voltage-cdev {
		compatible = "qcom,cc-cooling-devices";
		apc1_cluster: thermal-cluster-4-7 {
			 qcom,cluster0 = <&CPU4 &CPU5 &CPU6>;
			 qcom,cluster1 = <&CPU7>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};
	};
